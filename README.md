# Real-Estate-Price-Estimator-ML-beginners
This is beginner level project on machine learning though which we can predict the price of a real-estate property based on Boston database
Implemented the model using Linear Regressor, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression and compared scores to deploy
the model for predicting the price of real‚Äêestate property. With the most efficient machine learning algorithm.
